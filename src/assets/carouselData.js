The app supports full CRUD operations, links blog posts to pages with MongoDB relationships, and efficiently populates data with Mongoose population. It uses modular routes for scalability, implements basic error handling, and structures data with flexible NoSQL models. Upcoming improvements include user authentication, unit testing, enhanced API documentation, and deployment to Heroku or AWS. This project demonstrates my ability to design a scalable backend system with efficient data handling."

Each blog displays a preview, and users can click 'Read More' to view the full content, which is conditionally rendered based on the selectedBlog state. The component also uses a CommentSection that receives the selected blog's ID as a prop. Error handling is implemented to manage API fetch failures."

To ensure each comment is associated with a specific blog, I implemented a blogId in the comment data. Comments are dynamically added in real-time by updating the state after a successful POST request, allowing the UI to reflect new comments immediately."
